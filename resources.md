Earlier I stumbled accross this tutorial for using word pre-trained word embeddings  in keras: https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html



## Notes

Two different APIs: Sequential (used now) and Functional (used in the tutorial)

https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/

https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/

It seems that functional is mainly for more complex models.
